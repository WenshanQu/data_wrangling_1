```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## read in some data: using relative path (will still work on other people's computer)

read in the litters dataset.

`read_csv` is a function in readr

`clean_names` function did not contains in R or tidyverse, it's in `janitor` package, and we use `janitor::` to realize this without loading all the janitor package.

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```

## take a look at the data

printing in the console
```{r}
litters_df
```

```{r}
head(litters_df)
tail(litters_df)
```
# we only use one function `skim` in `skimr` package, so we do not load `library(skimr)`. we use `skimr::skim`
```{r}
skimr::skim(litters_df)
```
`view()` function is a useful function, but not usually put it in a code chunk!
```{r}
view(litters_df)
```
